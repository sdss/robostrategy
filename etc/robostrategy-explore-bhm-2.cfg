summary = Only Black Hole Mapper programs, with cost model C
description = For this test, we only include the Black Hole Mapper
  programs (SPIDERS, AQMES, and RM). We use the less punishing 
  cost model C (which is airmass^1 in dark time). This uses the 
  latest version of AQMES wide and medium (May 21 2019).
