summary = Galactic Genesis, WDs and CBs, forcing some subsampling the GG.
description = For this test, we only include the Galactic Genesis, WD,
  and CB programs. We set BrightOnlyBright, which is supposed to 
  ensure that bright cadences are only assigned bright time. We use 
  cost model C, which scales as airmass to the first power in dark 
  time. We limit the completeness we seek for GG to 75 percent.
