[Documentation]
summary = Test of BHM v0.2.1 target and fields relative to gamma-0-ob-0
description = Simplifed cadence requirements, the
    "gamma" schedule, and cost model D. 
		Regarding the simplified cadences, for YSOs, WDs, CBs,
		planet, OB, TESS OB, and 100pc cadences, we remove all
		restrictions on the cadences. Cost model D assumes increased
		exposure time of airmass<sup>1</sup> in dark time and 
    airmass<sup>0.05</sup> in bright time. Uses v0.2.1 BHM targets
    and field locations, which use off-grid fields to help 
    improve efficiency, and wander outside previous standard
    areas. Relative to v0.2.0, this increases the number of 
    BHM targets input.
