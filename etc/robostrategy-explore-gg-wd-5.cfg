summary = Galactic Genesis, WDs and CBs, forcing some subsampling the GG.
description = For this test, we only include the Galactic Genesis, WD,
  and CB programs. We adjust their cadences so that mwm_wd_3x1 and 
  mwm_cd_3x1 actually only have two dark time cadences. We use 
  cost model C, which scales as airmass to the first power in dark 
  time. We limit the completeness we seek for GG to 75 percent.
