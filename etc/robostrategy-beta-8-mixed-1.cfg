[Documentation]
summary = Same as beta-8 but with dark time forced in Plane (|b| < 10 deg)
description = Simplifed cadence requirements, the
    "normal" schedule, cost model D. It deliberately
		downsamples Galactic Genesis, and uses a 2x1 cadence
		for WDs. Regarding the simplified cadences, for YSOs, WDs, CBs,
		planet, TESS OB, and 100pc cadences, we remove all restrictions on the
    cadences. Cost model D assumes increased exposure time of 
    airmass<sup>1</sup> in dark time and airmass<sup>0.05</sup> 
    in bright time. This version includes CSC targets.  It uses 
    the new kaiju version from Jan 2020. It uses the DarkPlane 
    option to force at least 2 dark exposures for every field with
    |b| < 10 deg.
