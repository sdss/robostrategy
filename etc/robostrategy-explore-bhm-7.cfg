summary = Only Black Hole Mapper programs, with cost model D, with targets moved to SGC, and including CSC
description = For this test, we only include the Black Hole Mapper
  programs (SPIDERS, AQMES, and RM) plus CSC. We use the less punishing 
  cost model D (which is airmass^1 in dark time). This uses the 
  latest version of AQMES wide and medium (June 2019), which 
  moves targets to SGC. It uses the values in the database.  It is 
  the same as explore-bhm-6 except for the addition of CSC.
