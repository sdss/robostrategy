summary = Galactic Genesis and Black Hole Mapper programs
description = For this test, we only include the Black Hole Mapper
  programs (SPIDERS, AQMES, and RM) and Galactic Genesis. We use the
	less punishing cost model D. We require around 13000 BHM wide
  and around 2000 BHM medium targets at APO, and 150000 SPIDERS AGN
  and 20000 SPIDERS cluster galaxies. We move some galactic plane
  fields from APO to LCO to relieve a tension seen in explore-gg-bhm-0. 
  Set fgot_maximum to 0.8 as well.
