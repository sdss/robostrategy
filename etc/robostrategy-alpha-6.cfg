summary = Similar version to alpha-4 but with new BHM wide and medium
description = For this test, we simplify the cadence requirements 
		greatly. For YSOs, WDs, CBs, planet, TESS OB, and 100pc cadences,
    we remove all restrictions on the cadences. We have used the 
    "normal" schedule. Relative to alpha-3, we changed the way the 
    cadence choices are given so that we don't add RV cadences that
    aren't represented in the target cadences (this was a change in 
    the code, not a change in configuration). We have replaced the 
    wide and medium programs in BHM with the latest versions (May 21
		2019). Also uses the cost model C, which is more realistic.
