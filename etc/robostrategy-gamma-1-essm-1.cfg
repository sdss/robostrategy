summary = Test of extremely simple survey, fixed for OB and mwm_erosita
description = Simplifed cadence requirements, the
    "gamma" schedule, and cost model D. 
		Regarding the simplified cadences, for YSOs, WDs, CBs,
		planet, OB, TESS OB, and 100pc cadences, we remove all
		restrictions on the cadences. Cost model D assumes increased
		exposure time of airmass<sup>1</sup> in dark time and 
    airmass<sup>0.05</sup> in bright time. Uses v0.2.0 BHM targets
    and field locations for AQMES medium and RM. But for SPIDERS and
    Wide forces observations across all eROSITA_DE.  Note that 
    it doesn't have the TARGETS for that though. This version
    changes mwm_erosita_1x2 target cadences into mwm_erosita_2x1,
    fixes mwm_erosita_faint_2x2 so it is included, and adds the 
    mwm_ob program.
