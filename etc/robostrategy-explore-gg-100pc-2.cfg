summary = Galactic Genesis and 100pc, bright cadences use bright time, and realistic airmass cost
description = For this test, we only include the Galactic Genesis and
  100pc programs. We set BrightOnlyBright, which is supposed to 
  ensure that bright cadences are only assigned bright time. We use 
  cost model C, which scales as airmass to the first power in dark 
  time.
