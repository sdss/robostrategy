summary = Galactic Genesis, WDs and CBs, forcing some subsampling the GG.
description = For this test, we only include the Galactic Genesis, WD,
  and CB programs. The WD and CBs have only two dark time cadences.
  We FORCE all of the bright time cadences to have at least two 
  dark time observations. We use cost model D. 
  We limit the completeness we seek for GG to 75 percent.
